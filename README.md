# Insurance_Cost_Prediction

## Problem Statement
Insurance companies need to accurately predict the cost of health insurance for individuals to set premiums appropriately. However, traditional methods of cost prediction often rely on broad actuarial tables and historical averages, which may not account for the nuanced differences among individuals. By leveraging machine learning techniques, insurers can predict more accurately the insurance costs tailored to individual profiles, leading to more competitive pricing and better risk management.


## Project Need

Enhance Precision in Pricing: Use individual data points for accurate risk-based premiums.

Increase Competitiveness: Offer attractive and sustainable rates.

Improve Customer Satisfaction: Ensure fair, transparent pricing.

Enable Personalized Offerings: Tailor insurance packages to individual needs.

Risk Assessment: Refine risk assessment processes.

Policy Development: Inform new product development.

Strategic Decision Making: Aid in market entry and policy adjustments.

Customer Engagement: Use insights for personalized marketing and advice.
